# CUNY-All-Access
## How we built it
We built this using a variety of softwares and technologies. NFTexport.io was the foundation of the entire workflow where JSON files and metadata were created. IPFS desktop was used to turn the 3D artwork into a file stored on a decentralized file system. Javascript and Terminal were used hand in hand to finalize the NFT metadata. Perawallet.app enabled us to connect to the Algorand TestNet and mint the NFTs on the TestNet. Echo3D was used to create the 3D moving artwork and cartoonize.net was for visual effects on the original image. 

## Challenges we ran into
At first, we were having a hard time trying to decide which design to use to encompass all of CUNYs. We had multiple drafts with one containing all CUNY college logos but we ended up deciding to choose one which highlighted the students as it showed campus diversity and inclusion. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of picking up the project after failing the first version. Building an actual deployable NFT for the community and learning about the technology involved in building one. 

## What we learned
We learned to assign tasks and utilize online tools, such as Echo3D, Algorand TestNet, and NFTexport.io. The steps in making a technology product with multiple individuals and skillsets. 

## What's next for CUNY All Access
The next step for CUNY All Access is to discover more advanced authentication methods that implement the NFT into the CUNY system. Additionally, more research into current trends across industries like NFT tickets.

Competition: Currently most secure Authentication systems rely on biometrics like fingerprints. However those setups can cost upto 10,000 dollar per access point. Additionally, they are more subject to wear over time as they require contact with interfaces. However, with our product it is possible to have an overall cost of $40,000 for every current student which is the same as having 4 doors for one campus.  in our estimations and with the ability to more easily update students details in real time and less risk of loss of a physical ID card, it can be more cost effective

Industry Trends: NFT tickets are being utilized to ensure that ticket resales are not done illegally and to authenticate purchasers. Similar purpose to ours so we can look into this more and moreover and now allows for tickets to be easily collected. Can see people being able to hold onto their IDs for the future too.
